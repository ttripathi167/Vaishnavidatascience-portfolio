										<h2>Customer Loyalty Program - Clustering</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/jlcunha/Customer_Loyalty_Program_Clustering-" class="image fit"><img src="images/cluster.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Customer loyalty programs have gained significant importance in today's business scenery, driving sustainable growth and profitability. By fostering stronger connections with customers, these programs lead to increased repeat purchases and higher engagement levels.</p>
									<p>In this project, I developed a customer segmentation model using cluster techniques. The results showed that a specific cluster comprising just 11% of the total customers generates a remarkable 50% of the company's revenue. These insights enable the implementation of targeted marketing strategies tailored to each customer cluster, maximizing the effectiveness of the loyalty program.</p>
									<p>A Looker dashboard was created to deploy this project. It provides information about the company and the customer groups generated by the cluster model. The dashboard serves as a centralized platform for accessing insights and metrics related to the business and customer segmentation.</p>

										<h2>Classification - Learning to Rank</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/jlcunha/HealthInsuranceCrossSell" class="image fit"><img src="images/everguardian.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the probability of customers purchasing car insurance. The model was trained on data collected from existing customers who possess health insurance. By targeting only the customers who are most likely to purchase insurance, the company can reduce the cost of making unnecessary sales calls and improve its overall profitability.</p>
									<p>The final product of this project is a Google Sheets document that is linked to the machine learning model currently in production. This document provides a list of customers who are likely to purchase car insurance, based on the predictions made by the model.</p>
                                    <p>As a result of this project, the company has achieved a remarkable 106.91% increase in profitability due to significant cost savings from reducing the number of unnecessary sales calls.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Churn and low average ticket</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/jlcunha/NorthWind" class="image fit"><img src="images/NorthWind.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project focuses on addressing some of the challenges faced by the fictitious company North Winds, including issues such as disorganized data, customer churn, and low average ticket.</p>
									<p>To help solve these problems, I employed various Data Science techniques, such as optimizing the database organization, performing churn analysis, conducting cohort and RFM analyses, clustering customers based on their purchasing behavior, implementing a recommendation system, and introducing an Elastic Price strategy. </p>
									<p>Through the use of these techniques, we were able to provide valuable insights and solutions for North Winds, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and improve their overall profitability.</p>

										<h2>Time-Series Regression - Sales Forecast</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/jlcunha/rossmann_sales_forecasting" class="image fit"><img src="images/rossmann.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project focuses on predicting the sales forecast for the next 6 weeks of the Rossmann pharmacy chain, using Machine Learning models. The models were trained on historical sales data, and the results are delivered through a Telegram chatbot.</p>
									<p>Five different models were implemented, and the XGBoost model was selected as the most accurate. To deploy the model into production, Flask and Heroku's cloud were utilized, and the Telegram chatbot was created for users to access the predictions from anywhere.</p>
									<p>Overall, this project showcases the potential of Machine Learning in forecasting sales and highlights the benefits of using a chatbot to deliver the results conveniently.</p>

										<h2>Web Scraping for the Fashion Industry</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://github.com/jlcunha/starjeans_web_scraping" class="image fit"><img src="images/starjeans.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>To gain valuable insights into the fashion market, this project utilized Web Scraping to collect data on products and prices from an e-commerce clothing store. The collected data was then processed using various techniques including Regex, and for the final ETL stage, it was loaded into a SQLite database.</p>
									<p>To automate the data collection process, Cron was implemented. Additionally, a dashboard was created using Panel and HVPlot to visualize and explore key insights from the collected data.</p>

									<a href="https://github.com/jlcunha/House-Rocket" class="image fit"><img src="images/KingCounty.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The House Rocket project is focused on maximizing profits through real estate investment opportunities. The project involves multiple steps, including data collection, cleaning and transformation, visualization, exploratory data analysis, and the creation of a property recommendation application based on the user's preferences. </p>
									<p>The project also includes negotiation strategies, such as identifying properties with good resale potential and defining competitive prices. Overall, the goal is to provide the company with insights and tools to make informed decisions that will maximize profits in the real estate market.</p>
